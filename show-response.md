## üéØ What the User Sees

### **Top Level Fields:**
- `success` (boolean) - Whether the request succeeded
- `query` (string) - The original search query
- `answer` (string) - **AI-generated human-readable answer**
- `sources` (array) - The documents used to generate the answer
- `timestamp` (string) - When the response was generated

### **Answer Section:**
The AI combines all the source documents and creates a **natural language summary** that:
- ‚úÖ Lists all relevant people
- ‚úÖ Highlights their skills and experience
- ‚úÖ Provides context from the sources
- ‚úÖ Answers the user's question directly

### **Sources Section:**
Each source contains:
- `id` - Unique identifier for the document
- `content` - The actual text content from the database
- `metadata` - Any additional data (empty in this case)
- `relevanceScore` - How similar this document is to the query (0-1)

---

## üì± How Different Clients Can Use This

### **Web Frontend:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/ai/search?query=python+machine+learning');
const data = await response.json();

// Display the AI answer
document.getElementById('answer').textContent = data.answer;

// Show sources as a list
data.sources.forEach(source => {
  const li = document.createElement('li');
  li.textContent = source.content;
  document.getElementById('sources').appendChild(li);
});
```

### **CLI Tool:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/ai/search?query=python+developers" | jq .answer
# Outputs: "Based on the context, here are Python developers: ..."
```

### **Mobile App:**
```swift
struct SearchResponse: Codable {
    let success: Bool
    let query: String
    let answer: String
    let sources: [Source]
    let timestamp: String
}

struct Source: Codable {
    let id: String
    let content: String
    let relevanceScore: Double
}
```

## üîç Error Response Example

When something goes wrong:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "query": "",
  "error": "Query parameter is required",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

Or for internal errors:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "query": "some query",
  "error": "Failed to process search request",
  "details": "Vector store not configured",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T12:34:56.789Z"
}
```

## üí° Key Points

1. **Simple JSON Structure** - Easy to parse in any language
2. **Self-contained** - Everything needed in one response
3. **Transparent** - Shows both the AI answer AND the sources used
4. **Timestamped** - Know when the search happened
5. **Error-friendly** - Clear error messages when things fail

The user gets both:
- ü§ñ **AI-generated answer** (easy to read, conversational)
- üìö **Raw sources** (for verification and additional context)
